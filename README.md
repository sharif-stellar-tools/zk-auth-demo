# Zk-Proof-Identity

## Value Proposition
Zk-Proof-Identity is designed to solve the critical infrastructure bottlenecks currently facing developers on the Stellar network. By providing a highly modular, enterprise-grade architecture, we reduce integration time from weeks to hours, allowing teams to focus on building decentralized financial products rather than managing low-level RPC connections.
